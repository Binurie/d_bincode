/// Manages reusable [BincodeWriter] instances to optimize frequent serialization.
///
/// **Core Functionality:**
/// This pool optimizes performance by:
/// 1.  **Reusing Objects:** It maintains a queue (`Queue`) of idle `BincodeWriter`
///     instances. Instead of creating a new writer for every task, it tries
///     to provide one from the pool ([acquire]).
/// 2.  **Managing Size:** It controls the number of writer instances, creating
///     new ones on demand up to a configured maximum ([maxSize]). It can be
///     pre-warmed with an initial number of instances ([initialSize]).
///
/// This reduces object allocation overhead and minimizes garbage collection pressure.
///
/// ### Instantiation and Usage Patterns
///
/// `BincodeWriterPool` is a regular Dart class, meaning you can create as many
/// independent instances as needed within your application, limited only by
/// available memory and management complexity.
///
/// While often a single, shared pool instance is sufficient for an application, creating
/// **multiple pools** can be beneficial in specific scenarios:
///
/// - **Isolating Workloads:** If different parts of your application have vastly
///   different serialization patterns (e.g., one part serializes frequent small
///   messages, another handles infrequent large ones), separate pools can be
///   tuned ([initialSize], [maxSize]) independently for optimal performance
///   in each context.
/// - **Concurrency with Isolates:** In multi-isolate applications, each Dart isolate
///   can manage its own dedicated `BincodeWriterPool`. This avoids potential
///   contention or the need for complex synchronization mechanisms that might
///   arise if isolates shared direct access to a single pool's internal queue.
/// - **Testing:** Using distinct pool instances for different test suites or
///   scenarios ensures better test isolation.
///
/// Consider that managing multiple pools increases configuration overhead slightly.
/// Evaluate whether the benefits of isolation or specific tuning outweigh the
/// simplicity of a single shared pool for your use case.
///
/// **Recommended Usage:**
/// ```dart
/// // Typically, create one pool shared across relevant parts of your app:
/// final sharedPool = BincodeWriterPool(initialSize: 4, maxSize: 16);
///
/// // Use the pool via `use` or `useAsync`:
/// Uint8List data = sharedPool.use((writer) => writer..writeI32(123)..toBytes());
///
/// await sharedPool.useAsync((writer) async {
///   writer.writeString("hello async");
///   // ... process data ...
/// });
/// ```
